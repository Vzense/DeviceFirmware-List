20190322_b55:
	1. Solve the problem: when depth mode and depth+ir mode switch repeatedly, depth camera would not work.
	2. Make sure even switch to a range that is not calibrated, we can still transfer image data to SDK side.

20190904_b63:
	1. Solve the problem: when rgb data is compressed with mjpeg format, timestamp is abnormal and report data that are not synchronous.
	2. When sdk switch to unsupported output mode, this operation would not take effect.
	3. Solve the problem: switch from factory-test mode to depth+ir+15fps mode, image data is not valid.

	Note: For reducing power consumption, when switch to Depth+RGB, IR+RGB, Depth+IR output mode，and then the range is set to xfar, the depth or ir data is only 15fps.

20200625_b65:
	1. Solve the problem: when upgrading from 20190322 version to 20190904, alignment of depth and rgb does not work well.
	2. When setting pulse count, it works only if the depth range parameter equals current valid depth range.
	3. When rgb resolution is set to 640*480, rgb image quality is optimized greatly.
    4. PsDepthAndIR_15_RGB_30 mode is no longer supported.

20200720_b67:
	1. Solve the problem: after camera is connected to win10-professional OS, it takes a few minutes to get image from camera module.

	Note：This version has a bug：when switching to Depth+IR output mode, then switch to xfar range, the image data is not smooth and get stuck seriously.

20200825_b68:
	1. Fix the bug: when switching to Depth+IR output mode, then switch to xfar range, the image data is not smooth and get stuck seriously. 

20200922_b75:
	1. The initial state(output_mode, frame_rate, gmm_gain, etc...) can be configured by VzenseConfigTool. We can download VzenseConfigTool from following site:
	https://github.com/Vzense/VzenseConfigTool
	2. Support DepthAndIR_15_RGB_30 mode again.

20201010_b76:
	1. Fix the bug: when in xfar-range, set pulse-count failed.
	2. Fix the bug: when in wdr mode and set frame rate to 3fps, only near-range depth data is reported.

20201214_b77:
	1. Fix the bug: for some DCAM710 machines produced on 2019.08.28, when upgrading from 20190904_b63 to 20201010_b76, "MappedRGB" function does not work well.

20201229_b80:
	1. Support get alias name through UVC.
	2. Range offset order keeps pace with SDK.
	3. Default alias name for Firmware of factory version is empty.
	
20210813_b87:
	1. Fix the interface to get depth frame fate.
	2. Fix frame fate error in range 5.
	3. Fixed an issue where the first 30 frames were not reported in Depth mode.
	4. Adjust UVC packet logic to optimize transmission time
