	1. Solve the problem: when depth mode and depth+ir mode switch repeatedly, depth camera would not work.
	2. Make sure even switch to a range that is not calibrated, we can still transfer image data to SDK side.

	1. Solve the problem: when rgb data is compressed with mjpeg format, timestamp is abnormal and report data that are not synchronous.
	2. When sdk switch to unsupported output mode, this operation would not take effect.
	3. Solve the problem: switch from factory-test mode to depth+ir+15fps mode, image data is not valid.

20200625:
	1. Solve the problem: when upgrading from 20190322 version to 20190904, alignment of depth and rgb does not work well.
	2. When setting pulse count, it works only if the depth range parameter equals current valid depth range.
	3. When rgb resolution is set to 640*480, rgb image quality is optimized greatly.
    4. PsDepthAndIR_15_RGB_30 mode is no longer supported.
