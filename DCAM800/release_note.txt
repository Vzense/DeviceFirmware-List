	Release Noteï¼š
	1. Replace "pico zense" to "Vzense"
	2. Solve the problem: when set to range 0, frame rate becomes 15fps.
	3. When DCAM10 does not transfer image data, we would reboot DCAM10. After 5 times, if DCAM10 still does not transfer image data, we reboot the whole system.
	4. If command port receive invalid read command, we only report this issue and do not reboot system.

	note:
	This version should be used with MCU firmware(version: DCAM10_20200511).
